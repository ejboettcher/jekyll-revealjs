## jekyll-reveal.js for Minimal Mistakes and Revealjs 4.3



This jekyll-reveal.js works with a Minimal Mistakes jekyll template and Revealjs 4.3.  
Example: [Evelyn's pyohio talk](https://www.evelynboettcher.com/pyohio-pandas#/)

It is based on [jekyll-revealjs github repository](https://github.com/dploeger/jekyll-revealjs) which Jekyll-based framework for creating presentations based on Reveal.js and markdown.

The main difference is that you can call which markdown files you want to include in what ever order for your slide show in a html files (Example: slides.html). You do not have to populate the *_post* folder nor use the naming conventions in the original instructions below. In addition, you can simple add a slide show to an existing jekyll layout, see [pyohio-pandas talk ](https://www.evelynboettcher.com).  



## Introduction

If you like [Reveal.js][] for creating your online presentations, like the site
management [Jekyll][] gives you and like [Markdown][] because of its easy and clean look, here's an easy way to create a presentation using Jekyll, Markdown and Reveal.js.

See the [example presentation][] created using the contents in this repository and "jekyll build".

## Howto

First, [install Jekyll][]. After that, clone this repository and create a branch for your new presentation:

    git clone --recursive https://github.com/dploeger/jekyll-revealjs.git
    git checkout -b presentation1

Clean the Example presentation:

    git rm _reveal-slides/*
    mkdir _reveal-slides

Or create a new folder.

After that, add your slides into the _posts-subdirectory in clean Markdown syntax and you're ready to go with building your presentation with Jekyll:

    jekyll build

You can even manage multiple presentations using the power of git. Simply branch from the master branch to create a new presentation:

    git checkout master
    git branch presentation2
    git checkout presentation2

## Slide filenames

We're using the Jekyll framework to easily gather the slides for the presentation.
All slides need to be written in markdown.

## Configuring the presentation

You can configure almost any reveal.js setting using the _config.yml-settings file in the root directory.

* title: The title of your presentation (displayed in the browser's title bar)
* reveal_theme: The reveal.js-theme to use [default.css]
* reveal_transition: The reveal.js-transition to use [default]
* reveal_theme_path: The path to the reveal.js-theme (can be changed for custom themes) [reveal.js/css/theme/]
* reveal_notes_server: Wether to support the speaker notes server [false (only local speaker notes)]
* reveal_options: Additional reveal.js [options][]
* reveal_dependencies: Additional reveal.js [dependencies][]
* reveal_path: Path to the reveal.js-installation [reveal.js]


### Tell Jekyll to Import your Folder
If you are putting your slides into a folder other than *_reveal_slides* you will need to update your Collections and Defaults.



## Custom reveal.js-themes
You can also further customize the presentation:

* extra_css: Additional CSS files added after the reveal theme []

If you want to use your custom reveal.js-theme, we recommend adding a directory "theme", putting the file(s)
there and referencing that directory in the configuration "reveal_theme_path".

Don't mess with the reveal.js subdirectory as it is a subrepository and doesn't adhere to your repository's
branches.

## Markdown extensions and simplification

Reveal.js already includes a markdown interpreter, which we use for jekyll-reveal.js. We have already
configured it and included some simplification just for you!

### Multiple slides

To use multiple slides in one slide file, use a newline, three dashes and another newline like this:

    # Slide 1
    
    This is the content of Slide 1
    
    ---
    
    # Slide 2
    
    This is the content of Slide 2

### Vertical slides

To use vertical slides, do the same, but use two dashes:

    # Slide 1
    
    This is the content of Slide 1
    
    --
    
    And this is a vertical slide below Slide 1

### Fragments

Fragments allow slide elements to come one by one. This is often used in lists to subsequently show
fragments of a list during a presentation.

To use fragments, jekyll-reveal.js includes a jekyll-plugin, that simplifies the use of fragments
in markdown. To specify the current element as a fragment, use the *+* like this:

    # Slide
    
    + This 
    + will 
    + come one by one 



### Speaker notes

jekyll-reveal.js is configured, so that speaker notes are identified after an introductory "Note:"-tag:

    # Slide

    Some slide content

    Note:

    This is only displayed in the speaker notes.
